    <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Making Your First 3D Model</h1>

    <p><strong>October 22, 2014<br>
        11:00 am–12:00 pm<br>
        Alderman Library, Room 421<br>
    </strong></p>
    <p>This workshop introduces software, hardware, and techniques for creating a simple 3D model from an existing object. We’ll cover various ways of creating 3D models, demonstrate laser scanning with a Kinect and photogrammetry using a digital camera. We’ll spend most of the class capturing a model using photogrammetry, and if all goes well, you’ll leave the workshop with your own 3D model to embed on a web page, or edit to make a 3D print using our lab’s Makerbot. If you’d like to be a participant and not a spectator, bring a laptop and camera. (Cell phone cameras are fine!)

    <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Intro to 3D Modeling and Printing</h1>
    <p><strong>November 5, 2014</br>
        11:00 am–12:00 pm<br>
        Alderman Library, Room 421
    </strong></p>

    <p>This workshop will introduce participants to the exciting world of desktop fabrication. We’ll provide a brief overview of current trends and tools for 3D modeling and printing. We’ll also go over the basics of model creation with photogrammetry, and discuss how 3D printing works, including a live demonstration with our Makerbot Replicator 2. While not necessary, participants can bring a camera (cell phone cameras welcome!) and a laptop to get better acquainted with the software we’ll introduce.</p>
