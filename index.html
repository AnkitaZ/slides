  <h1>Praxis 2016-2017</h1>
  <p>Praxis is experimenting with time again this year--rather, how to represent non-linear time physically and digitally. We are sharing blog posts, rough notes, and sketches on the Praxis website! Check it out at praxis.scholarslab.org</p>

  <p> The project includes page images and transcriptions of both Jefferson’s privately printed 1784 edition and the 1787 edition printed by London publisher John Stockdale.</p>

  <h1>Neatline</h1>
  <p>Neatline is a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. It allows scholars and archivists to build on standard descriptive metadata and georectified maps to produce rich, evocative – even theoretical – spatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of catalogued letters, manuscripts, and artifacts.</p>
