  <h1>Praxis 2016-2017</h1>
  <p>Praxis is experimenting with time again this year--rather, how to represent non-linear time physically and digitally. We are sharing blog posts, rough notes, and sketches on the Praxis website! Check it out at praxis.scholarslab.org</p>

  <h1>Neatline</h1>
  <p>Neatline is a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. It allows scholars and archivists to build on standard descriptive metadata and georectified maps to produce rich, evocative – even theoretical – spatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of catalogued letters, manuscripts, and artifacts.</p>

    <h1>We Speak, We Make, We Tinker: Afrofuturism as Applied Digital Humanities</h1>
    <p><strong>Dr. Toniesha L. Taylor, Prairie View A&M University</strong></p>
    <p><strong>September 23, 2016<br>
        10:00 am–11:30 am<br>
        Alderman Library, Room 421</strong></p>

    <p>Dr. Taylor's talk will focus on the ways in which Afrofuturism and Digital Humanities can come together to bring their inherent creative theories, methods and applications together to engage in an equitable discourse to changes the future of the humanities. She will argue that born out of these collaborations could be new approaches which will engage knowledge productions in the areas of the humanities often relegated to “area studies” and recenter those contributions within their equitable portion of human knowledge.</p>
