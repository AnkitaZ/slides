  <h1>Neatline</h1>
  <p>Neatline is a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. It allows scholars and archivists to build on standard descriptive metadata and georectified maps to produce rich, evocative – even theoretical – spatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of catalogued letters, manuscripts, and artifacts.</p>

   <h1>Mapathon for Puerto Rico Disaster Relief</h1>
   <p>Thursday, November 2<br/>1:00-5:00pm<br/>Scholars' Lab Common Room</p>
   <p>Join the the Scholars’ Lab and the UVA Library to assist relief efforts in Puerto Rico. Many aid groups are reporting difficulty providing support to those in need because digital maps of the island are incomplete. Help us improve those maps using Open Street Maps. You will need a laptop, but no experience is required. Feel free to stop in anytime between 1:00 and 5:00, and stay for as long as you are able. We will have coffee and cookies for those participating.<br/>
