  <h1>Neatline</h1>
  <p>Neatline is a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. It allows scholars and archivists to build on standard descriptive metadata and georectified maps to produce rich, evocative – even theoretical – spatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of catalogued letters, manuscripts, and artifacts.</p>

    <p>Can institutions effectively manage cross-team digital research data in real time? Can it preserve that data so that it can be seamlessly presented in conjunction with publications? The Smithsonian Institution has built a pilot system, called Sidora, designed to be used by Smithsonian researchers to capture and organize digital “evidence,”  and use it directly in their analysis and dissemination activities. Staples demo the software, using research data from an archaeological site in Panama, and an international study of mammal populations.</p>
