  <h1>Neatline</h1>
  <p>Neatline is a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. It allows scholars and archivists to build on standard descriptive metadata and georectified maps to produce rich, evocative – even theoretical – spatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of catalogued letters, manuscripts, and artifacts.</p>

  <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Working with Arduinos III</h1>
  <p>Thursday, February 26</br>2:00 - 3:30pm</br>Alderman Library, Room 421</p>
  <p>New to microcontrollers? Or used an Arduino before and want more time to play in a supportive environment? Come on by! Arduino is a tool for making microcomputers that can sense and control the physical world. This workshop will introduce participants to the basics of physical computing and programming through a series of hands-on exercises using our Arduino kits. This workshop builds on the Working with Arduino I and II workshops, but they’re not required to attend this one. Instructor: Jeremy Boggs</p>

  <h1>GIS Workshop: Learning Old-School Mapping Techniques</h1>
  <p>Wednesday, March 4</br>1:00 - 2:00pm</br>Alderman Library, Room 421</p>
  <p>How did folks make maps before GPS and satellite imagery?  In this workshop we’ll focus on plane table mapping.  Using just a flat surface, a sheet of paper, a straight edge, and a pencil we’ll learn techniques to create accurate maps for large geographic areas.   With plane table mapping, if you can see it, you can map it.  This technique can be particularly helpful to researchers such a biologists working in small areas under heavy tree canopy where GPS fails. Instructor: Chris Gist</p>

  <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Intro to 3D Modeling & Printing</h1>
  <p>Thursday, March 5</br>2:00 - 3:30pm</br>Alderman Library, Room 421</p>
  <p>This workshop will introduce participants to the exciting world of desktop fabrication. We’ll provide a brief overview of current trends and tools for 3D modeling and printing. We’ll also go over the basics of model creation with photogrammetry, and discuss how 3D printing works, including a live demonstration with one of our Makerbots. While not necessary, participants can bring a camera (cell phone cameras welcome!) and a laptop to get better acquainted with the software we’ll introduce. Instructor: Jeremy Boggs</p>

    <h2>Democratizing the Digital Humanities: The American Yawp as Case Study</h2>
    <p><strong>Thursday, March 19, 2015<br>
        10:00 am<br>
        Alderman Library, Room 421</strong></p>

    <p>After a year-long collaboration, over 350 historians have produced a beta edition of <em>The American Yawp</em>, a free and online, collaboratively built, open American history textbook designed for college-level history courses. This talk will explore the creation and dissemination of this project, the landscape of open educational projects in the humanities, the methods used to harness the energy of hundreds of academics, and the potential for large-scale collaboration and open resources to make practical the democratic promise of the digital humanities.</p>
