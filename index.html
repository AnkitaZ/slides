    <h1>Remaking Victorian Miniatures: The Speculative Stitches between 2D and 3D</h1>
    <p><strong>November 20, 2014<br>
        10:00 am–11:30 am<br>
        Alderman Library, Room 421</strong></p>

    <p>In both digital humanities and popular culture, there is a rapidly growing interest in big data. But in this talk I shift the focus away from amounts of data and toward ways of seeing with computers. In this sense, contemporary computing is more about mediation than media, or more about vision than the visible. Ats of remaking involve serious speculation, and also rely quite heavily on computation to stitch together evidence in the presence of absences. In short, they are matters not of “how many” but of “how this becomes that.”</p>
