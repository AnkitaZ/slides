  <h1>Praxis 2015-2016</h1>
  <p>Praxis is experimenting with time--rather, how to represent time physically and digitally. We are sharing blog posts, rough notes, and sketches on the Praxis website! Check it out at www.praxis.scholarslab.org/time</p>

  <h1>Neatline</h1>
  <p>Neatline is a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. It allows scholars and archivists to build on standard descriptive metadata and georectified maps to produce rich, evocative – even theoretical – spatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of catalogued letters, manuscripts, and artifacts.</p>

  <p>In this interactive workshop, participants will learn the basics of photogrammetry by making their own 3D model out of regular 2D photographs. We will discuss practical applications of photogrammetry, as well as the different strategies and tools available to accomplish personal research goals. While not necessary, participants can bring a digital camera or smartphone and laptop to get better acquainted with the photogrammetry process and software. Instructor: Jennifer Grayburn</p>
