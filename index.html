<section class="slide project" id="neatline">
  <h1>Neatline</h1>
  <p>Neatline is a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. It allows scholars and archivists to build on standard descriptive metadata and georectified maps to produce rich, evocative – even theoretical – spatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of catalogued letters, manuscripts, and artifacts.</p>

<section class="slide" id="sarah-bond">
	<h1>Scholars' Lab Speaker Series: Sarah Bond</h1>
	<h2>Digital Humanities and Social Justice</h2>
	<p><strong>November 10, 2017<br>
		10:00am - Noon<br>
		Alderman Library, Room 421</strong></p>
	<p>Dr. Bond's talk will focus on how digital approaches — 3D modeling, augmented reality, GIS, and textual analysis, to name just a few — have begun to reveal evidence for social inequality, misogyny, racism, and marginalization. This talk will highlight just a few local and international DH projects working to these ends; from redlining maps to the statistical analysis of the gender pay gap at public universities. If democracy truly “dies in darkness,” then perhaps DH can contribute some flashlights to the cause.</p>
