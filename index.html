    <h1>Speaker Series: Dr. Kari Krauss</h1>
    <h2>Finding Faultlines: An Approach to Humanistic Design</h2>
    <p><strong>October 20, 2014<br>
        10:00 am–12:00 pm<br>
        Alderman Library, Room 421</strong></p>

    <p>Historically we know that many new technologies have inherited parts from prior technologies. The skateboard remediated the surfboard; the camera pilfered from the gun; the telephone harvested batteries and wires from the telegraph; and early models of the phonograph borrowed the treadle mechanism of the sewing machine. In each of these instances, the logic of part-whole relationships governs the design. Drawing inspiration from this assemblage model of design, Dr. Krauss will share research recently conducted at the University of Maryland investigating how individuals locate the fault lines in objects and analyze them into their component parts, and discuss several potential application domains, including the design of fragmented or non-finito products: intentionally unfinished things, such as a sketch, the torso of a statue, or an alternate reality game that incorporates mobile and web apps.</p>

    <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Making Your First 3D Model</h1>

    <p><strong>October 22, 2014<br>
        11:00 am–12:00 pm<br>
        Alderman Library, Room 421<br>
    </strong></p>
    <p>This workshop introduces software, hardware, and techniques for creating a simple 3D model from an existing object. We’ll cover various ways of creating 3D models, demonstrate laser scanning with a Kinect and photogrammetry using a digital camera. We’ll spend most of the class capturing a model using photogrammetry, and if all goes well, you’ll leave the workshop with your own 3D model to embed on a web page, or edit to make a 3D print using our lab’s Makerbot. If you’d like to be a participant and not a spectator, bring a laptop and camera. (Cell phone cameras are fine!)

    <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Intro to 3D Modeling and Printing</h1>
    <p><strong>November 5, 2014</br>
        11:00 am–12:00 pm<br>
        Alderman Library, Room 421
    </strong></p>

    <p>This workshop will introduce participants to the exciting world of desktop fabrication. We’ll provide a brief overview of current trends and tools for 3D modeling and printing. We’ll also go over the basics of model creation with photogrammetry, and discuss how 3D printing works, including a live demonstration with our Makerbot Replicator 2. While not necessary, participants can bring a camera (cell phone cameras welcome!) and a laptop to get better acquainted with the software we’ll introduce.</p>
