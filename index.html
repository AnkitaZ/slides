  <h1>Praxis 2016-2017</h1>
  <p>Praxis is experimenting with time again this year--rather, how to represent non-linear time physically and digitally. We are sharing blog posts, rough notes, and sketches on the Praxis website! Check it out at praxis.scholarslab.org</p>

<section class="slide project" id="neatline">
  <h1>Neatline</h1>
  <p>Neatline is a mix-and-match toolset for the creation of interlinked timelines and maps as interpretive expressions of the literary or historical content of archival collections. It allows scholars and archivists to build on standard descriptive metadata and georectified maps to produce rich, evocative – even theoretical – spatial and temporal visualizations of the textual content of catalogued letters, manuscripts, and artifacts.</p>

<section class="slide makerspace" id="python-workshop">
  <h1>Workshop: Web Scraping in Python</h1>
  <p>Wednesday, February 8</br>10:00 - 11:30am</br>Alderman Library, Room 421</p>
  <p>Sometimes data we find on the internet isn’t formatted for downloading and easy importing into our statistical program of choice. To get this data requires “web scraping,” pulling out specific parts of a web page and wrangling that content into a structure suitable for further analysis. Python has a number of libraries that work together to make this process relatively painless. Some knowledge of Python would be helpful. Instructor: Eric Rochester</p>
