<h3> Old Media Studies: New Wine in Old Skins</h3>
    <p><strong>
    November 14, 2014<br>
    10:00 am<br>
    Alderman Library, Room 421<br>
    </strong></p>
    <p>Eddie Izzard asks us if we have a flag, and generally speaking, medievalists must answer in the negative. In this talk, Kathleen E. Kennedy unfurls the banner of Old Media Studies and argues that the interdisciplinary, transtemporal future of Medieval Studies may lie right under our hands, in the very books which serve as our primary research resources. Come hear about medieval hackers, Anonymous, and the prayerbook owned by one of Skelton’s associates and a crony of Henry VIII.</p>
