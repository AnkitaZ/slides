  <h1>Makerspace Workshop: Working with Arduino I</h1>
  <p>Wednesday, October 28</br>12:30 - 2:00pm</br>Alderman Library, Room 421</p>
  <p>Are you interested in learning about creative ways to sense and control parts of the physical world around you, through applications of electronics and coding? At this workshop, you will have the opportunity to gain an introduction to the basics of physical computing, components of the Arduino software, and examples of projects that used the software. We will also start getting our hands dirty with the technology, so that you can develop your own ideas, and for those who have more advanced physical computing skills, you will be free to work ahead and more independently. Instructor: Margaret Furr</p>
